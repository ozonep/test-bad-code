# Sci-code Front-end Coding Challenge

## Summary

This repository is built using html/css, Javascript, Webpack and babel7, using SPA (React), SPA Routing and REST api.

The focus of this application is to show all my understanding of frontend-development using React.

This project is an attempt at an replica of a prototype presented by Sci-code AS, where the frontend is mostly put together using components.

All buttons and dropdowns are clickable, however they won't change the contents already present to the user. Instead I passed props to most of the components indicating for flexible change if needed.

note to Sci-code: This challenge was actually very fun! I spent days getting stuck on how to properly implement a graph, and webpack errors, etc.
It really gets my mind going, I realise theres alot of improvement to be made but I really enjoyed the process!

also instead of using canvasjs I switched to nivo, I didn't utilize canvasjs as it has a trademark copyright sign on the bottom.

To get started start from the root folder and perform:

## Setup Instructions:

Starting from the root directory

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev OR yarn dev`

### `Open a browser and enter localhost:8080`

npm run dev / yarn dev will create a **bundle.js** file at the ./public folder
and starts a **single NodeJS instance serving both the frontend and backend** , at server port 8080.
The application will also reload using nodemon everytime a change has been made.
